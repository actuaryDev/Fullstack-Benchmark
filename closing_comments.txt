Please take the time to reflect on how you feel you did on the following concepts.

Q: How do you feel about your understanding of the client server relationship? What blind spots do you feel you have about the connection between these two?

Q: How do you feel on your ability to create route handlers server side? I.E. Get route for retrieveing documents, Post route for creating documents. What blind spots do you feel you have about this concept?
